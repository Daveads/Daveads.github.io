In some programming language e.g python indentation expresses how a control structure should behave, making changes to the indentation changes the code's behavior, python uses indentation to indicate a block of code (a group of statement)

Examples

```
 if 5 > 2:
    print("five is greater than two!")   	
```

```
 name = "David"
 
 if len(name) > 0:
     message = 'name is not empty'
     print(message)
```






python version used : python 3.7.3
