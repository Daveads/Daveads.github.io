     Objective:
<li>Understand the basics of version control System</li>

	<li>using the <a href="">terminal emulator</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git:</a> you do need git on your computer to be able to follow this tutorial</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/">github account</a><li>
